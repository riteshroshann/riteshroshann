## hey there!!

ai undergrad exploring the science of representation learning and computational modeling. i study how neural networks parameterize functions, encode geometry, and organize latent manifolds — with emphasis on spatial intelligence, multimodal alignment, and inductive biases across data regimes. broader interests include scientific ml, cryptosystems, and quantum-safe security, with scaling behavior as a proxy for generalization.

i train small models from scratch, replicate baselines, implement ablations, and debug training dynamics (optimization, initialization, regularization, curricula, data pipelines). comfortable operating across theory (linear algebra, probability, information theory), implementation (pytorch, cuda, jit, kernels), and systems (distributed training, inference, deployment, monitoring). 

long-term interest in architectures that exhibit algorithmic priors, support compositional reasoning, and integrate geometric or physical constraints. also curious about post-quantum cryptography and quantum-enhanced computational models.
