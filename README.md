## hey there!!

ai undergrad exploring the science of representation learning and computational modeling. i study how neural networks parameterize functions, organize latent manifolds, and exploit inductive biases across data regimes. interested in multimodal alignment, scientific ml, cryptosystems, and scaling behavior as a proxy for generalization.

i train small models from scratch, replicate baselines, implement ablations, and debug training dynamics (optimization, initialization, regularization, curricula, data pipelines). comfortable operating across theory (linear algebra, probability, information theory), implementation (pytorch, cuda, jit, kernels), and systems (distributed training, inference, deployment, monitoring).

long-term interest in architectures that exhibit algorithmic priors and support compositional reasoning.
