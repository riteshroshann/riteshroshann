## hey there!!

ai undergrad working at the interface of representation learning, scientific computing, spatial intelligence, and post-quantum security. i study how neural networks actually implement computation in weight space: how they parameterize functions, encode geometry, and organize latent manifolds under constraints of optimization, data, and compute. this means interrogating inductive biases, scaling laws, and the mechanisms that make generalization possible.

i map the field through its primitives: supervised, unsupervised, and rl define the regimes of feedback; deep learning is differentiable representation learning at scale; architectures are coordinates in a large design space shaped by symmetry, compositionality, and compute budgets. mlps, cnns, transformers, and diffusion models are not endpoints but historical artifacts of how we exploit structure in data and hardware. the relevant questions are why these forms exist, what priors they encode, and what constraints of physics, numerics, and systems shaped them.

practically, i build from first principles. i train models from scratch, replicate baselines until the loss curves match, and dissect optimization dynamics at the grain of initialization, data pipelines, and kernel-level execution. i move vertically across the stack: from the theory of information and cryptography, down through pytorch/cuda/kernels, up to distributed training, inference stacks, and deployment under real-world latency–throughput–cost trade-offs.

looking ahead, i’m focused on architectures that do more than interpolate — models that integrate statistical learning with geometry, compositional reasoning, control, and the constraints of physical and cryptographic systems. i believe secure inference and post-quantum threat models will reshape how learning systems are built, monitored, and trusted. ultimately, i care about unifying representation, generalization, and security under both classical and quantum limits.
