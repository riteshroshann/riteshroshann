## hey there!!

ai undergrad working at the intersection of representation learning, scientific computing, spatial intelligence, and quantum-secure systems. i study how neural networks parameterize functions, encode geometry, and organize latent manifolds — with particular interest in inductive biases, multimodal alignment, and the structure of learned representations. i’m also exploring quantum-safe cryptography and post-classical computational models, especially how quantum-era threat models reshape secure inference and large-scale learning systems.

i train models from scratch, reproduce baselines, implement ablations, and study training dynamics across regimes (optimization, initialization, regularization, curricula, data pipelines). comfortable moving across theory (linear algebra, probability, information theory, cryptography), implementation (pytorch, cuda, jit, kernels), and systems (distributed training, inference stacks, deployment, monitoring).

long-term interest in architectures that exhibit algorithmic priors, support compositional and geometric reasoning, and integrate constraints from physics, simulation, and quantum-secure computation. ultimately fascinated by models that unify statistical learning, structure, and generalization under both classical and quantum computational limits.
